TODOS:

I can GET an entire thread with all it's replies from /api/replies/{board}?thread_id={thread_id}. The reported and delete_passwords fields will not be sent.

  I can delete a post(just changing the text to '[deleted]') if I send a DELETE request to /api/replies/{board} and pass along the thread_id, reply_id, & delete_password. (Text response will be 'incorrect password' or 'success')
